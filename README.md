## Mist
Discord bot for accessing steam using `steamapi`

## Features
- Displaying steam profiles
- Resolving steamID


## TODO:
- [ ] Eval should probably be removed from main.js and moved to anoter file in repo so it would be used only for debugging
- [ ] Creating a slash command isn't implemented or even explained
- [x] Error handling (currently bot just crashes if there is an error with steamapi lib)
- [ ] Puppeteer screenshot steam profile showcase
